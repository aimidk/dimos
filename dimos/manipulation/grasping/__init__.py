"""Grasping and pick-place manipulation.

Modules:
- GraspGenModule: Docker-based neural network grasp generation
- PickPlaceModule: Unified pick/place orchestration with BT-based execution

The PickPlaceModule is the agent-facing interface for grasping operations.
It internally calls GraspGenModule for grasp generation.
